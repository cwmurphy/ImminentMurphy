One telltale sign: piles of yellow sticky notes begin to stack up around the edges of my workspace.\n    \n- I'm not routinely scanning through all my disconnected notes for outstanding next actions / dangling tasks at the end of the work day.\n    \n- I'm not consistently making time for a comprehensive weekly review of everything. (And then I lose trust in what I’ve captured.)\n \n- I don't spend enough time ruminating within the Someday/Maybe list.  \n\n- I don't always start each day by scanning through my lists of next actions and prioritizing. (Which means sometimes I spend time on less important things for entirely arbitrary reasons.)\n\n- I don't keep a standalone list of all my personal and professional projects updated. Where is all my energy going?  (I’m doing work - but am I working on the the most meaningful, impactful things?)\n\n- I don't fully articulate what success / completion looks like for all of my projects. (How does my brain know it can stop thinking about this stuff?)\n\n- I rarely celebrate - or even acknowledge - my progress, the series of smaller wins throughout the day, the week, the year.\n\nTo summarize: \n\nWhen it seems like my software is at fault, sometimes it 's because I’m being inconsistent. I’m not reviewing things as often as needed. I’m generally not thinking enough about the work to be done, the value I expect it to generate, or the opportunities I need to explore.\n\nAnd sadly, no software tooling can compensate for this.\n",

You’ll be able to focus more later when you have more time. Just drop it for now&hellip;”</em></p>\n<p>I took a brief break and I realized that I hadn’t bothered to jot down even a single note during a lesson to help organize my thinking or jog my memory about the concepts. I was still essentially winging it every time I sat down.</p>\n<p>And so I discovered what Google Collab is and immediately started taking notes in it.  (NOTE: DataCamp also introduced a built-in notebook feature, in-line with the rest of the learning experience. Like I mentioned earlier: you really don’t need to install or configure anything else to use this.)</p>\n<p>I adjusted my thinking:</p>\n<p><em>“I am discouraged because I’ve been presented an entirely new concept for the first time in a five minute long video which I have watched only once&hellip; without taking notes&hellip; and I haven’t instantly mastered it. Is this realistic? It is not.”</em></p>\n<p>I would remind myself of this, re-adjusting my thinking over and over again, while completing the rest of the learning track.</p>\n<p>It took approximately 90 hours, 25 courses, and 1308 exercises from start to finish.</p>\n<h3 id=\"tldr\">TL;DR</h3>\n<p>Your time is precious and DataCamp is an effective, highly affordable educational platform for learning data science. From start to finish, I went from filthy Python casual to actually tuning machine learning model hyperparameters.</p>\n<p>It’s really remarkable. Highly recommended.</p>\n<h3 id=\"datacamp-summary\">DataCamp summary</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>All learning activities are delivered via a web browser or app. No additional software needs to be purchased, installed, or configured so there’s little friction to start learning.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Each topic is divided into a series of lessons and exercises.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Individual lessons are delivered via instructor-led videos, all of which were clear and concise (not lasting more than 6 minutes).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Several interactive exercises are paired with each lesson and serve to reinforce the new concepts. All of these were either writing entirely new lines of original code or filling in the blanks in different python samples. And if you should stumble on an exercise, several hints are available - as well as the final answer. This approach gently moves the student from a passive learner to an active practitioner.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Learning tracks are a series of progressively more complicated topics, interspersed with projects. These standalone projects provide opportunities to directly apply lessons using examples that mirror real-world scenarios. If parts of the project are difficult for you, there are links directly back into previous lessons for more practice.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>When you successfully complete all the work within a Learning Track, you have the option of taking additional tests to achieve a certification. This is a useful credential for showcasing your expertise to both peers and employers (which I ultimately decided not to pursue).</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n",

This proved to be quite the struggle. I found myself doing lots of googling and experimenting while trying to figure out how to do all things that I had ostensibly learned previously.\n\nThis first project was a real application of the content from the first two modules. I came out of it feeling both very accomplished and quite humbled.\n\n### II.\nI started working on the “Data Manipulation with Pandas” course - and that’s when I slammed [face first into the Wall.](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/creativity-without-borders/202211/how-hit-the-wall-and-come-back)\n\nThe lesson videos started showing increasingly complex Python commands and data analysis concepts, in nearly linear relationship to how it was increasingly difficult to keep it all straight in my head.\n\nAnd this is when [the ever-present Voice of Resistance](https://stevenpressfield.com/books/the-war-of-art/) started its seductive whispers:\n_“You are discouraged because perhaps this is all just too complex for you to handle - at the moment. You’ll be able to focus more later when you have more time. Just drop it for now...”_\n\nI took a brief break and I realized that I hadn’t bothered to jot down even a single note during a lesson to help organize my thinking or jog my memory about the concepts. I was still essentially winging it every time I sat down. \n\nAnd so I discovered what Google Collab is and immediately started taking notes in it.  (NOTE: DataCamp also introduced a built-in notebook feature, in-line with the rest of the learning experience. Like I mentioned earlier: you really don’t need to install or configure anything else to use this.)\n\nI adjusted my thinking:\n\n_“I am discouraged because I’ve been presented an entirely new concept for the first time in a five minute long video which I have watched only once... without taking notes... and I haven’t instantly mastered it. Is this realistic? It is not.”_\n\nI would remind myself of this, re-adjusting my thinking over and over again, while completing the rest of the learning track.\n\nIt took approximately 90 hours, 25 courses, and 1308 exercises from start to finish.\n\n### TL;DR\nYour time is precious and DataCamp is an effective, highly affordable educational platform for learning data science. From start to finish, I went from filthy Python casual to actually tuning machine learning model hyperparameters.\n\nIt’s really remarkable. Highly recommended.\n\n### DataCamp summary\n- All learning activities are delivered via a web browser or app. No additional software needs to be purchased, installed, or configured so there’s little friction to start learning.\n\n- Each topic is divided into a series of lessons and exercises.\n\n- Individual lessons are delivered via instructor-led videos, all of which were clear and concise (not lasting more than 6 minutes).\n\n- Several interactive exercises are paired with each lesson and serve to reinforce the new concepts. All of these were either writing entirely new lines of original code or filling in the blanks in different python samples. And if you should stumble on an exercise, several hints are available - as well as the final answer. This approach gently moves the student from a passive learner to an active practitioner.\n\n- Learning tracks are a series of progressively more complicated topics, interspersed with projects. These standalone projects provide opportunities to directly apply lessons using examples that mirror real-world scenarios. If parts of the project are difficult for you, there are links directly back into previous lessons for more practice.\n\n- When you successfully complete all the work within a Learning Track, you have the option of taking additional tests to achieve a certification. This is a useful credential for showcasing your expertise to both peers and employers (which I ultimately decided not to pursue).\n",
